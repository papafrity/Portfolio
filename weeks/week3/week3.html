            Week3 notes/exercises - A year ago I could say that I did not understand what the objects were, now I see them again after a while I can understand it better.
            I can tell that objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
            
                 When I read about DOM I did not imagine that it was so long and complex to understand, if I understood correctly it is when a page is loaded, the browser creates a DOM (Document Object Model) of the page.
                 The HTML DOM model is built with a tree of objects, and with this object model we have a javascript that gains all the power that is needed to have a dynamic HTML page.
            
                 I really enjoyed reading about events, you can add very simple functions to your page and make it react in different ways from loading the page and doing something, to clicking and having various functions.

                    Professor, will we use the DOM a lot in our pages? And if so, what are we going to use the most?
