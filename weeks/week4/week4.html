            Week4 notes/exercises - what I read about forms is that it is a fundamental and most used part 
            of many pages. when you have to fill in information to create accounts or start a session or to 
            give functionality to the page, such as saving work done, obviously in conjunction with the databases.

            Object-oriented programming is something that I always found difficult to understand and learn, 
            lately I have come to understand a little more about constructors and many more things, also 
            like polymorphism.
