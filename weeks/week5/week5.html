            Week5 notes/exercises - The debugger tool is very useful, even before this week when I was 
            reading about everything it could do, I used it and it was always very useful. there are 
            applications on the internet that help you with things like this, but having a tester in 
            each browser and the famous devtools make the task easier, because when I started learning 
            javascript a few years ago, I used the console to see each result, and then I learned how to 
            put it on a page, I must admit that these weeks have been very difficult for me because even 
            though I had knowledge of javascript there are things that are difficult for me to understand, 
            but now I am understanding much better.
