            Week1 notes/exercises - I focused on learning how to use github and how to do this week's homework, I really don't know if I could do it well, I hope it is okay. I read the book and so far I am understanding what I read, even though I still couldn't do it without help.
            <h3>Questions: </h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    one of my questions is if we are going to be using a lot of javascript? because I will have to review it, I have not participated in a javascript class for years.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Is the sitepoint page going to be used a lot for homework?
