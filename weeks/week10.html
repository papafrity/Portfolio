            I've been reading a bit about fetch and from what I understand it provides an interface to access and 
            manipulate parts of a url. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I understood that fetch won't reject on HTTP 
            error status.
            From what i read fetch works fine with post and won't send cross-origin cookies unless you set the 
            credentials init option.

            Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of a good user experience; by 
            capturing invalid data on the client side, the user can correct it immediately. If it reaches the 
            server and is then rejected, there is a noticeable delay due to a round trip to the server and then 
            back to the client side to tell the user to correct their data.

                    fetch is like an alternative for ajax? I read in an article that ajax was not going to be used as much as before.
