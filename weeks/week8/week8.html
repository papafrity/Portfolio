            Without a doubt it is a very big world when we talk about customizing or animating a web page, I find it 
            very entertaining to customize a page in my own style, I was reading in chapter 12, I could not understand 
            canvas correctly, I see it quite complex to understand it in a week, as soon as svg I could understand a 
            little better how it works, as its name mentions it Scalable Vector Graphics is a way of creating images 
            with coordinates or mathematical operations, and this is used for the computer to form an image and no 
            matter how big is the zoom will always look good. These topics interested me a lot and I will continue 
            looking for information on this.
